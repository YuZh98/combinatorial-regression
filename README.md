# Statistical Modeling for Combinatorial Response Data Reproducibility Repository

This repository contains code and data to reproduce the results in the paper.

All commands must be run from the repository root.

Generated outputs are written to:

```
results/
```

---

# Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Sanity check

```bash
make smoke
make probit_smoke
```

Runs a lightweight simulation and data analysis to verify everything works.

---

### 2️⃣ Main simulation study (MH-within-Gibbs)

```bash
make full
```

- The default setting does not run full grid of simulation settings in the paper to save time. To run the sampler in custom settings, change the corresponding enviroment variables first. See Section 6 in ```REPRODUCIBILITY.md``` for details. 
    

- Outputs saved under: (default is 1000)
  ```
  results/runs/mh_within_gibbs/
  ```

---

### 3️⃣ Kernel comparison (supplementary)

```bash
make kernel_compare
```

- Runs both:
  - exponential
  - half_gaussian

- Outputs saved under:
  ```
  results/runs/mh_within_gibbs/kernel_compare/
  ```

---

### 4️⃣ Data analysis (waterfowl matching)

Full model:

```bash
make duck_full
```

Reduced model:

```bash
make duck_reduced
```

- Outputs saved under:
  ```
  results/data_analysis/<RUN_TAG>/
  ```

# ⚙️ Custom Settings

All scripts support environment-variable overrides. For more details, see section 6 in ```REPRODUCILITY.md```.

Example:

```bash
JASA_N_ITER=20000 make full
```
```bash
JASA_METHODS=exponential,half_gaussian make full
```
